# 🚗 Used Car Marketplace — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A data-driven study of pricing, demand patterns, and vehicle attributes in the Indian used-car market.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a used-car dataset from CarLoop, an Indian automotive e-commerce platform.

The goal of this project is to uncover meaningful insights related to pricing, vehicle condition, brand popularity, fuel preferences, seller behavior, and market trends.

Unlike predictive modeling workflows, this project is entirely exploratory and focuses on:

- Understanding relationships between variables  
- Detecting patterns and anomalies  
- Discovering factors that influence used-car pricing  
- Summarizing business-ready insights
